# Determinism-before-Reasoning Ordering

Canonical ordering: `docs/spec/rfc-001/07_CANONICAL_ORDERING.md`.

## Common violations

- Reasoning over an entire repository before enumerating and narrowing scope.
- Using “seems relevant” as a scope selector.
- Explaining around missing artifacts instead of returning to deterministic steps.
