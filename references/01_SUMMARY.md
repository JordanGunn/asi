# ASI Summary

- ASI solves an expectation problem: capability is often mistaken for behavior.
- Agentic systems are silent unless invoked explicitly and correctly.
- ASI is a behavioral contract (governance layer), not a protocol or backend.
- Skills are policy-gated entry points: what an agent is allowed to do under rules.
- Determinism comes before reasoning: define and narrow the surface measurably first.
- Reasoning must not compensate for missing deterministic outputs.
- Passive means passive: observe/report; no auto-repair, no background mutation, no silent “help”.
- Failure is better than ambiguity: if guarantees cannot be upheld, stop and report.
- Scope must be explicit: what was considered, what was read, what changed.
- If state is written, it must be auditable and valid under declared schemas/templates.
- Derived state is preferred when persistence exists: rebuildable from canonical sources.
- Agent-derived metadata must be explicitly marked and removable without loss of truth.
- The goal is trustworthiness: reproducible behavior and explainable outcomes.
