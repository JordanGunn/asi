# ASI (Agent Skill Interface)

> ASI is a behavioral contract for agentic systems that defines determinism-before-reasoning, strict passivity, explicit failure semantics, and auditable scope.

## Just Use It

Skip the theory. If you're in an environment with ASI skills available, invoke directly:

```text
/asi-kickoff   → Design a new skill (produces KICKOFF.md)
/asi-plan      → Plan the work (produces PLAN.md + TODO.md)
/asi-exec      → Execute with receipts (produces RECEIPT.md)
```

The skills enforce ASI principles automatically. You don't need to understand the spec to benefit from it.
