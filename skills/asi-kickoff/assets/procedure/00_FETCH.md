# Step 0: Fetch ASI Documentation

**Before any kickoff work begins**, fetch and internalize the ASI design documentation.

---

## Procedure

1. Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JordanGunn/asi/refs/heads/master/llms.txt`
2. Parse `llms.txt` to identify key documentation paths
3. Navigate and read the referenced design principles and specifications
4. Establish comprehensive understanding of:
   - ASI manifesto and core principles
   - Skill design specifications
   - Deterministic surface requirements
   - Judgment isolation patterns

---

## Output

Agent has internalized ASI design principles before proceeding to kickoff.

---

## Why Fetch?

This makes the skill **portable**—agents can execute kickoff without requiring local ASI documentation. The canonical source is always the remote repository.

---

## Verification

Before proceeding to Step 1, confirm you can answer:

- What is the ASI manifesto's core thesis?
- What is the deterministic surface principle?
- How should judgment be isolated in skill design?
- What are the required sections of a KICKOFF.md?

If uncertain on any point, re-read the fetched documentation.
