# Open Questions

This step captures unresolved decisions that cannot be safely made during kickoff.

Unasked questions are a primary source of skill rot.

## Question types to surface

- Ambiguous requirements
- Missing constraints
- Conflicting goals
- Unclear lifecycle expectations
- Undefined reset or teardown behavior

## Rules

- Do not answer these questions
- Do not speculate
- Do not hide uncertainty

Each question should be phrased so a human can answer it directly.

## Output of this step

A concise list of blocking or deferrable questions for review.
