# Step 2 — Identify the Judgment Remainder

After deterministic reduction, the agent must examine what remains.

This remainder defines the **only legitimate space for agent reasoning**.

## Valid judgment categories include

* Subjective interpretation
* Editorial review or synthesis
* Situations with multiple valid outcomes
* Heuristic parameter selection
* Agent-generated inputs
* Agent-interpreted outputs

## For each judgment-based item, document

* What decision must be made
* Why it cannot be deterministic
* The judgment category
* The **blocking reason** preventing determinism
* Explicitly disallowed shortcuts or assumptions

## Constraint

These items must be **identified but not implemented**.

Unjustified reasoning or hidden scope expansion is a failure mode.
