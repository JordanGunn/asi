# Failures

## Missing skill path

- Ask the user for the exact directory that contains the target `SKILL.md`.
- Do not proceed until the path is confirmed.

## Missing SKILL.md

- Confirm the directory is correct.
- If the skill lacks `SKILL.md`, treat it as out-of-scope for enhancement.

## Incomplete frontmatter

- Record the gap in the enhancement report.
- Propose a safe, minimal fix.

## Unclear goals

- Pause and ask for desired outcomes and constraints.
- Do not guess about behavior-changing enhancements.
