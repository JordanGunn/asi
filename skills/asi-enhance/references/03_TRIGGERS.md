# Triggers

Use `asi-enhance` when:

- A user asks to upgrade a skill into ASI-style structure.
- A skill needs hardening for reliability, performance, or security.
- A skill has TODOs or missing resources that require formalization.
- A skill needs explicit validation, reporting, or artifact outputs.

Do not use `asi-enhance` for creating new skills from scratch; use `asi-kickoff` instead.
