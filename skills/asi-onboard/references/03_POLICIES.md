# Policies

## Always

- Always keep context scoped to the user’s current goal or topic.
- Always record what sources you consulted and why.
- Always keep `NOTES.md` concise and durable.
- Always preserve idempotency so re-running extends or reconciles state without duplication.

## Never

- Never create `.asi/kickoff/*` or `.asi/plan/*` artifacts.
- Never implement changes to the repository.
- Never modify repo docs or specs as part of onboarding.
- Never claim you have read a file you did not read.
