# Always

- Always keep context scoped to the user’s current goal/topic.
- Always record what sources you consulted and why.
- Always keep `NOTES.md` concise and durable (favor invariants over details).
- Always preserve idempotency: re-running should extend or reconcile state, not duplicate noise.
