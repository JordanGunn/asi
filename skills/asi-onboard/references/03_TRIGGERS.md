# Triggers

Use `asi-onboard` when:

- You are new to this repository and want a quick, repeatable way to build context.
- You need to re-establish context before planning or executing changes.
- You want disk-backed notes (not ephemeral chat-only context).

Do **not** use `asi-onboard` when:

- You want to create or revise a skill design artifact (`asi-plan` / `asi-kickoff`).
- You want to decompose work into tasks (`asi-plan`).
- You want to implement code or docs changes (`asi-exec`).
