# Summary

## Identity

`asi-creator` is the ASI skill that creates other skills under deterministic governance. It is not a general project planner or coding assistant.

## Scope

It performs:

- kickoff (intent + deterministic surface + judgment remainder)
- planning (PLAN.md + TODO.md)
- controlled execution (single task at a time, with receipts)

## Constraints

- Deterministic gates before every phase
- Explicit user confirmation for decisions
- CLI-owned schema emission and validation
- Read-only until gated execution
