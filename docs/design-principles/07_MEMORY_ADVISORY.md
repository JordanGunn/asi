# 07. Treat Memory and References as Advisory, Not Authoritative

Persisted information is not truth unless revalidated.

- References, prior decisions, and stored memory may be outdated or superseded.
- Do not treat historical artifacts as doctrine without confirming current relevance.
- Prefer current state and time-aware signals over memory.

This prevents acting correctly on information that is no longer correct.

## Why this matters for ASI

ASI treats “memory” and available state as capability, not proof of awareness or correctness. Revalidation and drift detection keep invocation and reasoning grounded in current state (`docs/spec/rfc-0001-asi.md`).
