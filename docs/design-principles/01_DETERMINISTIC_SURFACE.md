# 01. Maximize Deterministic Surface Area

Prefer deterministic mechanisms wherever possible.

- Use scripts, structured commands, and mechanical processes to define what exists and what can change.
- Prefer repeatable discovery and validation over speculative interpretation.
- Avoid asking an agent to do work that can be reasonably mechanized (for example: file enumeration, filtering, schema validation).

Deterministic surface area is not about control for its own sake; it is about creating a stable reality for reasoning to occur within.

## Why this matters for ASI

This supports ASI’s sequencing model: deterministic discovery/narrowing and validation establish the bounded surface that reasoning is allowed to operate on (`docs/spec/rfc-0001-asi.md`).
