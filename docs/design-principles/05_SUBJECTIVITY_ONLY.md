# 05. Reserve Agent Influence for Irreducible Subjectivity

Use agents primarily where deterministic coverage cannot exist.

Appropriate uses include:

- choosing parameters where humans are bad at selecting optimal values
- resolving ambiguity between multiple valid interpretations
- qualitative judgment or lightweight review once facts are established
- selecting next steps once ground truth is surfaced

Avoid using agents to invent structure, discover reality, or substitute reasoning for missing determinism.

## Why this matters for ASI

ASI draws a line between capability and behavior. Reserving judgment for irreducible subjectivity prevents “explaining around” missing deterministic outputs and helps keep failure semantics honest (`docs/spec/rfc-001/.INDEX.md`, `docs/spec/rfc-003/.INDEX.md`).
