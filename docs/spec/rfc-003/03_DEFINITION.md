# Definition: ASI-compatible

A system is **ASI-compatible** if its agent + skill surface enforces:

- skills as the policy-gated entry point for stateful capability
- determinism before reasoning (surface reduction before broad interpretation)
- strict passive behavior (no background mutation; no auto-action without intent)
- explicit failure semantics (fail loudly; no silent degradation)
- observable scope, reads, writes, and validation status
