# Abstract

Agentic systems often expose capability (tools, memory, skills) without providing a trustworthy contract for **behavior**. ASI (Agent Skill Interface) is a governance layer that defines a strict ordering (determinism before reasoning), a strict passive behavior contract, and explicit failure semantics so that outcomes are auditable and non-magical.
