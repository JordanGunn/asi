# Problem statement

Users commonly assume that:

- exposed tools will be used automatically
- memory implies recall and awareness
- skills “kick in” when relevant

In practice, agentic systems are silent unless invoked explicitly and correctly. When capability is mistaken for behavior, ecosystems respond by adding prompts, more tools, more memory, or background logic. This does not fix invocation and often reduces trust.

ASI exists to ensure that if something happens, it is explainable and attributable — and if nothing happens, that can still be correct.
