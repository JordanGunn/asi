# Definitions

- **ASI (Agent Skill Interface):** A behavioral contract that governs how an agent may reason, reduce scope, and mutate state through skills.
- **Agent:** An interpreter that accepts user testimony, performs reasoning, and chooses whether to invoke skills, within ASI rules.
- **Skill:** A policy-gated entry point that provides explicit guarantees and prohibitions for an operation.
- **Deterministic surface reduction:** A measurable, repeatable process that enumerates a universe of inputs and narrows it without guessing.
- **Passive behavior:** The posture that systems may observe and report, but do not act (mutate state) without explicit user intent and explicit invocation.
- **Artifact:** A declared output (files, records, reports) used as a completion signal.
- **Validation:** A deterministic hard gate that proves declared artifacts and invariants hold.
