# Canonical ordering

ASI assumes the following ordering as a mental model:

1. Define the universe (deterministic discovery)
2. Narrow deterministically (deterministic narrowing)
3. Act on the narrowed surface (deterministic execution)
4. Prove it worked (deterministic validation)
5. Think about it (subjective reasoning / interpretation)
6. Record it (human-facing artifacts and summaries)

If a skill includes phases analogous to these, it **MUST** preserve the invariant that subjective reasoning does not precede or substitute for deterministic surface reduction and validation.
