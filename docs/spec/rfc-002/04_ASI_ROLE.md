# ASI’s role (governance, not capability)

ASI defines:

- deterministic surface reduction before reasoning
- skills as policy-gated entry points
- strict passive behavior (observe/report; no auto-action)
- explicit failure semantics and observability requirements

ASI does not define transports, wire protocols, or storage schemas.
