# Why any MCP server benefits from an ASI layer

When MCP servers “fail expectations”, the common response is to add prompts, tools, or memory. This does not solve the invocation problem.

Adding an ASI layer clarifies:

- what a user can expect to happen
- what will not happen without intent
- what was actually read/changed
- why a failure occurred

This improves trust in the system and fairness in how capabilities are evaluated.
