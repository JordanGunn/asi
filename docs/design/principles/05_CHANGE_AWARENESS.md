# 03. Use Time-Awareness and Change Detection to Prevent Rot

Ground reasoning in current reality, not historical truth. This prevents acting correctly on information that is no longer correct.

- Use explicit invalidation signals to detect change and staleness
- Leverage battle-tested tooling like VCS, timestamps, hashes, etc.
- Persisted information is not truth unless revalidated.
- Use temporal signals to distinguish “this was true” from “this is still true”.
- References, prior decisions, and stored memory may be outdated or superseded.
- Do not treat artifacts as doctrine without confirming current relevance.
- Prefer current state and time-aware signals over memory.
- Memory and References are advisory, not authoritative.
