# 05. Reserve Agent Influence for Irreducible Subjectivity

Use agents primarily where deterministic coverage cannot exist.

Appropriate uses include:

- choosing parameters where humans are bad at selecting optimal values
- resolving ambiguity between multiple valid interpretations
- qualitative judgment or lightweight review once facts are established
- selecting next steps once ground truth is surfaced

Avoid using agents to invent structure, discover reality, or substitute reasoning for missing determinism.
