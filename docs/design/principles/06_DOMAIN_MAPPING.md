# 08. Map Static, Quantitative, and Qualitative Domains Explicitly

Distinguish the domains of information before implementation:

## Static Information

Guardrails that constrain reasoning: CLI-owned schemas and templates, fixed references.

## Quantitative Outcomes

Deterministic results produced by tools or scripts.

## Qualitative Judgment

Subjective decisions made by agents when determinism cannot reasonably or appropriately provide a solution.
