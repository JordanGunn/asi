# 01. Maximize Deterministic Surface Area

Prefer deterministic mechanisms wherever possible.

- Use scripts, structured commands, and mechanical processes to define what exists and what can change.
- Prefer repeatable discovery and validation over speculative interpretation.
- Avoid asking an agent to do work that can be reasonably mechanized (for example: file enumeration, filtering, schema validation).
