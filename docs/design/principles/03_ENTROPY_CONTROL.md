# 02. Control Entropy with Schemas and Templates

Use schemas, templates, and static structures as epistemic guardrails.

- Prefer assets that constrain the reasoning space (schemas, templates, controlled vocabularies).
- Schemas define shape, not behavior; templates define bounds, not outcomes.
- If the output of a process matters, define its structure ahead of time.

This prevents agents from inferring meaning where none was intended and makes validation mechanically possible.
