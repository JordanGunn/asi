# 12. Treat Tokens as a Finite Epistemic Budget

Tokens aren’t just cost; they are attention.

- Every unnecessary read dilutes reasoning quality.
- Smaller surfaces lead to better decisions, not just cheaper ones.
- Context should be earned, not ambient.

Token efficiency is a correctness concern, not just an optimization.

## Why this matters for ASI

ASI relies on bounded surfaces and explicit scope. Treating tokens as an epistemic budget reinforces the same goal: earn context through deterministic reduction rather than ambient full-corpus reading (`docs/spec/rfc-001/.INDEX.md`).
