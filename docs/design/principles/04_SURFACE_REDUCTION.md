# 04. Reduce the Reasoning Surface Before Reasoning Begins

Avoid reasoning over an unbounded or ambiguous surface.

- Reduce the problem space first using deterministic discovery mechanisms.
- Enumerate, filter, and constrain what can be seen before asking an agent to decide.
- Treat the narrowed set as the only valid surface for interpretation.

Smaller, well-defined surfaces reduce tool calls, preserve context, and lower token cost.
