# ASI Execution Model

This section describes the **execution model** implied by ASI-style skills: where ambiguity is permitted, where determinism is mandatory, and where judgment is allowed—without leaking authority into scripts or letting agents invent reality.

The goal is not to prescribe tooling.  
The goal is to make the **boundary semantics** legible and repeatable.
