# Model Limitations

## What this model is not

* Not a framework
* Not a lifecycle spec
* Not a tool prescription
* Not an excuse to add skills

It is a **shared mental model** for keeping agent intelligence in the right place: downstream of determinism, inside explicit contracts, and always auditable.
