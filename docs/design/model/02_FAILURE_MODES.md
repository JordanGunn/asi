# Failure Modes

## Why this model exists

Agent systems fail in predictable ways when boundaries are unclear:

* **Agents decide reality** (speculative reads, assumed files, invented scope)
* **Scripts decide meaning** (opaque ranking, heuristic "relevance", hidden state)
* **Passive artifacts become authority** (conventions replace contracts)
* **Outputs become unauditable** (no record of why decisions were made)

ASI-style skills are designed to prevent these failures by forcing a clean separation:

* Deterministic mechanisms establish **what is true**
* Skills and contracts govern **what choices are allowed**
* Judgment exists, but only after the world has been mechanically reduced
