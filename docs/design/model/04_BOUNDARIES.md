# Boundary Rule

## The boundary rule

A useful invariant:

* **Scripts determine reality.**
* **Skills govern choice.**
* **Judgment is allowed only after deterministic surface reduction.**
* **Judgment must be constrained and inspectable.**

If a step admits exactly one correct outcome for a given input, it belongs in deterministic execution (script/internal), not in the public skill interface.
