# 04_PROCEDURE.md — The canonical execution path

**Purpose**:

* Define how the skill is executed, step by step.
* Serve as the default path unless explicitly overridden by routing.

**Contains**:

* Ordered steps.
* Expected inputs and outputs.
* Checkpoints or validation moments.
* References to scripts or CLI commands where applicable.

**Constraints**:

* Linear flow.
* Minimal branching.
* No policy discussion.

This is where deterministic execution is described.
