# 03_POLICIES.md — Always and Never policies

**Purpose**:

* Encode non-negotiable invariants and prohibited behaviors.

**Contains**:

* “Always” rules and hard invariants.
* “Never” rules and forbidden behaviors.

**Constraints**:

* Absolute language only.
* No branching.
* No procedures.

This file replaces the split between `04_NEVER.md` and `05_ALWAYS.md` with a single policy surface.
