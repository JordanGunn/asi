# 01_SUMMARY.md — What this skill *is*

**Purpose**:

* Orient the agent *quickly*
* Reduce misclassification and overreach

**Contains**:

* What the skill does
* What problems it is meant to solve
* What it is *not* meant to do
* High-level constraints (language-agnostic, deterministic-first, etc.)
* Invocation shape (primary user prompt) and any additional explicit scope inputs

**Constraints**:

* ≤ ~300 words
* Declarative only (no imperatives)
* No conditionals, no branching logic

**This is the “identity” document.**
If the agent misunderstands this, everything else fails.
