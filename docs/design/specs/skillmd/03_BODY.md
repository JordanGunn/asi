# Body

`SKILL.md` should contain a minimal Markdown body.

## Canonical body format

- The body should contain a single H1: `INSTRUCTIONS`.
- The body should explicitly direct the reader to `metadata.references`.
- Additional prose should live in reference files.

## Canonical example

```md
 # INSTRUCTIONS

1. Refer to `metadata.references`.
```
