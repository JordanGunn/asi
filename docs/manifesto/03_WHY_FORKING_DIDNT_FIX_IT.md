# Why Forking Didn’t Fix It

When MCP servers fail expectations, the instinctive response is to patch:

- add prompt injection to improve reasoning
- add memory to improve awareness
- add tools to improve coverage
- add background logic to “help”

These forks are well-intentioned—and almost always ineffective.

Because **no amount of reasoning fixes a system that was never correctly invoked**.

There is no perfect balance of prompts, tools, and resources that turns capability into intent.
If such a balance existed, someone would have found it by now.

The problem was never *inside* the MCP server.
