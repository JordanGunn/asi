# The Illusion of Passivity

Most users—*including experienced builders*—implicitly assume that:

- exposed tools will be used
- available state implies awareness
- memory implies recall
- skills imply execution
- good prompts imply correct behavior

None of these assumptions are true.

Agentic systems are **not passive**.
They do nothing unless invoked—explicitly, correctly, and in the right order.

An MCP server does not “work” in the background.
A skill does not “kick in” because it seems relevant.
A tool does not “help” unless it is deliberately used.

The system is silent by default.

And silence is often misdiagnosed as failure.
