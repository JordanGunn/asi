# Skills Didn’t Magically Solve This Either

The Agent Skills specification was a major step forward.

It acknowledged something important:

> tools alone are not enough—agents need structured entry points.

But “skills” introduced a new abstraction with an old risk.

The word *skill* is accurate—and dangerously vague.

A skill can mean:

- a deterministic operation
- a suggestion
- a workflow
- a heuristic
- a guess wrapped in natural language

When natural language becomes a contract for machine execution,
**scope becomes instinctive instead of explicit**.

Why glob files when you can say:

> “Check all the files with postgres in them”?

Why constrain the surface when the agent *seems* smart enough?

Because instinct is not determinism.
And instinct is not auditable.
