# We Didn’t Have a Tooling Problem

We had an expectation problem.

The modern agent ecosystem is full of powerful tools.

Tools expose file systems, memory stores, APIs, databases.
Skills let us define arbitrarily complex capabilities.
Everything looks capable. Everything looks ready.

And yet, again and again, people say:

> “These tools don’t work.”
>
> "This MCP server sucks."
> 
> “It looks great on paper, but nothing happens.”

This is not because tools are poorly built.
It is not because skills are insufficiently clever.
It is not because the community lacks effort or intelligence.

It’s because **capability has been mistaken for behavior**.
