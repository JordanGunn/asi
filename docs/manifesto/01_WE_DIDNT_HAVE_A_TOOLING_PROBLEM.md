# We Didn’t Have a Tooling Problem

We had an expectation problem.

The modern agent ecosystem is full of powerful tools.

MCP servers expose file systems, memory stores, APIs, databases.
Agent skills let us define arbitrarily complex capabilities.
Everything looks capable. Everything looks ready.

And yet, again and again, people say:

> “This MCP server sucks.”
> “These tools don’t work.”
> “It looks great on paper, but nothing happens.”

This is not because MCP servers are poorly built.
It is not because skills are insufficiently clever.
It is not because the community lacks effort or intelligence.

It’s because **capability has been mistaken for behavior**.
