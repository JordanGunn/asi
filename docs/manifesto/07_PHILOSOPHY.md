# The Philosophy

## 1. Determinism Before Reasoning

Agents may not reason over undefined reality.

First, the surface is reduced—explicitly and measurably.
Only then may interpretation occur.
Mutation is optional, constrained, and visible.

## 2. Skills Are Policy, Not Convenience

A skill is not “something the agent can do.”
A skill is **something the agent is allowed to do**, under rules.

## 3. Capability Does Not Imply Behavior

Tools expose *what is possible*.
ASI defines *what is valid*.

## 4. Passive Means Passive

Systems may observe and report.
They may not act without intent.

No auto-repair.
No background mutation.
No silent “help.”

## 5. Failure Is Better Than Ambiguity

If guarantees cannot be upheld, the system must stop.

Partial success is corruption with better PR.
