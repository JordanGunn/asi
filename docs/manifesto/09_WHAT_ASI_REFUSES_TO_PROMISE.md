# What ASI Refuses to Promise

ASI does **not** promise:

- that agents will “figure it out”
- that tools will be used automatically
- that memory implies understanding
- that capability implies correctness

ASI promises something harder—and more valuable:

> **If something happens, you will know why.**
> **If nothing happens, that will also be correct.**
