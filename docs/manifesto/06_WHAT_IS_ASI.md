# What ASI Is

The **Agent Skill Interface (ASI)** is not a new protocol.
It does not redesign skills or replace existing capability layers.

ASI is a **behavioral contract**.

It exists to define:

- when reasoning is allowed
- what may be reasoned over
- how scope is constructed
- how state is written
- how failures surface
- what *must never happen silently*

ASI does not make agents smarter.
It makes systems **trustworthy**.
