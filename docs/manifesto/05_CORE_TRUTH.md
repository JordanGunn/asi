# The Core Truth

**Agentic systems are black boxes—even to the people who build them.**

This is not a moral failure.
It is a structural reality.

When reasoning, tools, memory, and execution are all blended together:

- no one knows what ran
- no one knows why
- no one knows what changed
- no one knows what was even considered

ASI exists because this is not acceptable for real work.
