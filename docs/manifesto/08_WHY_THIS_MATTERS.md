# Why This Matters

Without a governing layer:

- users blame tools for not thinking
- builders add heuristics instead of structure
- systems rot quietly
- trust erodes
- automation becomes folklore

With ASI:

- expectations are explicit
- invocation is intentional
- behavior is reproducible
- state is auditable
- tools are judged fairly

Tools stop being blamed for things they were never designed to do.
Skills stop pretending to be magic.
