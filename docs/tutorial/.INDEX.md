# Tutorial Index

This tutorial series teaches how to design an ASI-style grep skill using a deterministic boundary and a small, auditable skill interface surface.

Audience:

- maintainers and skill authors
- contributors learning ASI design through a concrete walkthrough

Prerequisites:

- familiarity with ASI design docs (`docs/design/.INDEX.md`)
- basic understanding of shell/CLI usage
- intent to build a grep-style skill interface surface (interface-first)

What this tutorial is:

- a step-by-step guide for designing a skill interface surface
- a "why-first" sequence that explains each design choice
- a checkpointed walkthrough with expected outcomes

What this tutorial is not:

- a deep implementation walkthrough of CLI internals
- a replacement for normative specs
- a language-specific coding guide

## Terminology

Canonical tutorial terms:

- `skill interface surface`: primary term for the public agent-facing skill interface.
- `deterministic boundary`: primary term for the execution boundary owned by deterministic mechanisms.
- `reasoning contract`: primary term for constrained agent planning/interpretation shape.
- `canonical references`: primary term for `01_SUMMARY` through `04_PROCEDURE`.
- `checkpoint evidence`: primary term for artifacts required to pass chapter checkpoints.

Context-specific subordinate terms:

- `wrapper command surface`: use only when discussing `help/init/validate/schema/run`.
- `endpoint`: use only in endpoint minimization decisions (chapter `08` and related checklist items).
- `schema contract`: use only as a subtype of the reasoning contract.

This terminology guide is tutorial-local and non-normative relative to design/spec source documents.

## How To Use This Tutorial

- Sequential mode: read `01` through `09` in order for first-time skill authors.
- Selective mode: jump to a specific chapter for a targeted correction (for example, help design or schema contract quality).
- Review mode: use chapter checkpoints and chapter `09` as a completion gate.

5. [Use help to enable self-correction](./05_USE_HELP_TO_ENABLE_SELF_CORRECTION.md)
6. [Use schema as reasoning contract](./06_USE_SCHEMA_AS_REASONING_CONTRACT.md)
7. [Build procedure with checkpoints](./07_BUILD_PROCEDURE_WITH_CHECKPOINTS.md)
8. [Keep endpoints small and composable](./08_KEEP_ENDPOINTS_SMALL_AND_COMPOSABLE.md)
9. [Review checklist and next steps](./09_REVIEW_CHECKLIST_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md)

## Completion Standard

Tutorial completion `MUST` satisfy all of the following:

- all chapter checkpoints are completed with required evidence
- chapter `09` completion checklist is fully satisfied
- review evidence package is assembled and auditable

## Boundary Reminder

This tutorial explains skill interface surface and governance design for strong skill behavior. It `MUST NOT` be used as a deep internal implementation guide for CLI internals.

Expected end state:

- a grep-style skill interface surface with small endpoint exposure
- deterministic onboarding and validation flow
- clear separation between deterministic execution and agent judgment
- reviewable artifacts and checkpoints for auditing
