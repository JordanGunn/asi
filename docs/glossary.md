# Glossary

- **Agent:** The interpreter that evaluates user testimony, reasons, and decides whether to invoke skills.
- **ASI (Agent Skill Interface):** A behavioral contract that governs sequencing (determinism before reasoning), passivity, observability, and failure.
- **Artifact:** A declared output used as a completion signal.
- **Deterministic narrowing:** Read-only reduction of scope over a discovered universe without guessing.
- **Deterministic discovery:** Enumeration of the complete input universe in a repeatable way.
- **Deterministic surface reduction:** Discovery + narrowing that bounds what the agent may reason over.
- **Failure semantics:** The rules for how failure is detected and surfaced (fail loudly; no silent degradation).
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** A capability layer for tools and persistence; not a governance layer.
- **Passive behavior:** Observe/report without acting; no auto-repair or background mutation.
- **Validation:** Deterministic proof that declared artifacts/invariants hold.
