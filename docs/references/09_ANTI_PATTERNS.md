# Anti-patterns

- **Prompt injection as governance:** attempting to enforce policy by stuffing instructions into prompts rather than enforcing a skill contract.
- **Magical memory:** treating persistence as awareness, recall, or correctness.
- **Background intelligence:** adding always-on behavior that mutates or “maintains” without explicit intent.
- **Reasoning over unconstrained corpora:** interpreting undefined reality instead of deterministically reducing the surface first.
