# Conformance Checklist

Canonical checklist: `docs/spec/rfc-003/05_CONFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`.

Use this file only as a short reminder:

- Entry points are skill-gated and explicit.
- Determinism precedes reasoning; scope is bounded and reported.
- Passive means passive; no background mutation.
- Validation and observability are non-negotiable.
