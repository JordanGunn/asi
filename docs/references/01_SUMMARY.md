# ASI Summary

Canonical reference: `docs/spec/rfc-001/.INDEX.md`.

Short reminder:

- ASI is governance: behavior is explicit, not inferred from capability.
- Determinism before reasoning; scope is bounded and reported.
- Passive means passive; no background mutation.
- Failure is better than ambiguity; report clearly.
