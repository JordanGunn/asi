# ASI Invariants

- Determinism before reasoning is non-negotiable.
- Skills are the policy boundary; ad-hoc capability invocation is forbidden.
- Passive behavior is strict: observation is allowed; mutation requires explicit intent.
- Scope must be explicit and reportable; silent widening is forbidden.
- Validation is a hard gate for declared artifacts and invariants.
- If a guarantee cannot be upheld, fail loudly; do not degrade silently.
