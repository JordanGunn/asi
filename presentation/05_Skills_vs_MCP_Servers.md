# Skills vs MCP Servers

<!-- fit -->

## MCP server (capability layer)

- Exposes **tools/resources** (APIs, files, databases, etc.)
- Answers: “What can the agent access/do?”

## Skills (governance + workflow layer)

- Define **valid behavior** at a boundary
- Constrain scope, structure the procedure, enforce validation
- Answers: “What is allowed, in scope, and how do we prove it happened?”

## How they fit together

- MCP can expand capability
- Skills should constrain behavior and increase trust

<!--
Speaker notes:
- Don’t over-index on protocols: keep it “capability vs behavior”.
