# Boundaries: Natural Language, Judgment, Determinism

<!-- fit -->

## Natural language is the interface, not the contract

- NL input is high-entropy: it needs constraints before execution
- If a rule matters, encode it structurally (schema/template/procedure)

## Where “agent judgment” is appropriate

- Choosing between multiple valid interpretations
- Prioritizing, summarizing, framing
- Selecting next steps *after* the surface is narrowed deterministically

## Where judgment is dangerous

- Inventing structure (new steps/formats) when missing
- Expanding scope silently (“I also checked…”)
- Declaring success without validation
