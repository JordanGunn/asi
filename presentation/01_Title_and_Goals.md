# Skills: Reliable, Auditable Agent Workflows

<!-- fit -->

**Audience**: Scientists & analysts (can code; not developers)  
**Time**: 15–20 minutes  

## Today

- What a *skill* is (and is not)
- Skills vs MCP servers (capability vs governed behavior)
- Skill structure: `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`
- Boundaries + failure modes (how to keep skills trustworthy)

Trust comes from **observable, constrained behavior**, not from “smartness”.

<!--
Speaker notes:
- Keep an “analyst-first” tone: reproducibility, auditability, controlled scope.
