# ASI: A Practical Way to Make Skills Trustworthy (Plug + Next Steps)

<!-- fit -->

## ASI in one sentence

ASI is a **behavioral contract**: it defines when reasoning is allowed, what may be reasoned over, and what must never happen silently.

## Why mention ASI here?

- It operationalizes good skill design into a gated workflow: design → plan → execute
- It’s protocol-agnostic: capability can come from anywhere; governance is the point

## If you want to go deeper

- Pipeline overview: `docs/SKILLS.md`
- Manifesto entrypoints: `docs/manifesto/.INDEX.md`
- Design principles: `docs/design/principles/.INDEX.md`
- Skill structure specs: `docs/design/specs/.INDEX.md`

## Internal next step suggestion

- Use a “skill for skill creation” (e.g., `skill-creator`) to turn a vague workflow into a spec-compliant skill with guardrails.
