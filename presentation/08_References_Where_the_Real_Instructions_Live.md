# `references/`: Where the Real Instructions Live

<!-- fit -->

## Purpose

- Intent: what the skill is for, and the binding contract for use
- Policies: what the agent may/may not do (governance and constraints)
- Procedure: the ordered steps (mechanically checkable where possible)
- Optional routing: selecting which references apply (when needed)

## Canonical minimal set (common pattern)

- `00_ROUTER.md` (optional; routes to the right docs based on preconditions)
- `01_SUMMARY.md` (what it is / isn’t)
- `02_INTENT.md` (intent contract)
- `03_POLICIES.md` (policy constraints)
- `04_PROCEDURE.md` (the “how”)

## Live example

- `skills/asi-creator/references/`
