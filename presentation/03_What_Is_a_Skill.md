# What Is a Skill?

<!-- fit -->

## Practical definition

A skill is a **packaged policy + procedure** for agent work:

- What is **in scope** (and what is not)
- What the agent is **allowed** to decide
- What must be **deterministic** (scripts, schemas, templates)
- How we know it **worked** (validation + observable artifacts)

## What skills aim to do

- Make outcomes **repeatable** enough to trust
- Make decisions **auditable** (“why this choice?”)
- Reduce “agent folklore” into an explicit workflow

<!--
Speaker notes:
- Emphasize: “skills govern choice; scripts do mechanics”.
- Prep reading: `docs/manifesto/07_PHILOSOPHY.md`, `docs/design/principles/11_INTERFACES.md`
