# Why Skills Exist: The Expectation Gap

<!-- fit -->

## Common expectation (often wrong)

- “Tools are available → the agent will use them”
- “Memory exists → the agent will remember”
- “A skill exists → it will ‘kick in’”
- “A good prompt → correct behavior”

## Reality

- Agentic systems are **passive by default**
- Nothing happens unless **invoked correctly**, in the **right order**
- “Capability” is often mistaken for “behavior”

## What goes wrong without governance

- Silent scope creep (“I also checked X…”)
- Non-reproducible results
- “Success” that can’t be validated
