## Invoke When

- List criteria that justify invoking the skill.

## Do Not Invoke When

- List criteria that indicate the skill is not appropriate.
- Include explicit “do not infer” cases.

## Stop Immediately If

- List conditions that should cause early termination.

## Important

“Triggers” here means invocation criteria, not automation.

- It does not imply background execution.
- It does not imply auto-invocation “when relevant”.
- Invocation still requires explicit user intent and an explicit decision to run the skill.
